# SOLID Principles 

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Definition:**
    - A class should have only one reason to change.

- **Example:**
```javascript
class User {
    constructor(name, email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }
}

class UserDB {
    save(user) {
        // Code to save user to the database
    }
}
```
In this example, User is responsible for user information, while UserDB handles data storage.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Definition:**
    - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  
- **Example:**
- **Before:**
```javascript
class Circle {
    drawCircle() {
        // Code to draw a circle
    }
}
```
- **After:**
```javascript
class Circle {
    draw() {
        // Code to draw a circle
    }
}
```

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Definition:**
    - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality.

- **Example:**
```javascript
class Bird {
    fly() {
        // Code to fly
    }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    fly() {
        throw new Error("Ostriches can't fly");
    }
}
```

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Definition:**
    - A client should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.

- **Example:**
- **Before:**
```javascript
class Machine {
    print() {
        // Code to print
    }
    scan() {
        // Code to scan
    }
}
```
- **After:**
```javascript
class Printer {
    print() {
        // Code to print
    }
}

class Scanner {
    scan() {
        // Code to scan
    }
}
```

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Definition:**
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

- **Example:**
- **Before:**
```javascript
class LightBulb {
    turnOn() {
        // Code to turn on the light
    }
}

class Switch {
    constructor(bulb) {
        this.bulb = bulb;
    }
    flip() {
        this.bulb.turnOn();
    }
}
```

- **After:**
```javascript
class Switch {
    flip() {
        // Code to flip the switch
    }
}

class LightBulb {
    turnOn() {
        // Code to turn on the light
    }
}

class Switch {
    constructor(device) {
        this.device = device;
    }
    flip() {
        this.device.turnOn();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
- **Benefits:**
    - Applying SOLID principles leads to more maintainable, scalable, and testable code.
    - It promotes separation of concerns and reduces code duplication.
    - SOLID principles help in creating robust and flexible software systems.
    - They improve code readability and make it easier to understand and modify.
    - Following SOLID principles can lead to better software design and architecture.
    - They encourage good coding practices and help in avoiding common pitfalls in software development.
    - SOLID principles are widely used in object-oriented programming and software development to enhance code quality and maintainability.
    - They provide a foundation for creating high-quality software that is easy to extend and maintain over time.
