# Architectural Requirements (RAs)

## Introduction
- **What are RAs?**
    - Architectural Requirements are crucial for software development, particularly in the planning phase. They encompass mainly the non-functional requirements that impact the software's architecture directly.

## Importance of RAs
- **Impact on Software Architecture:**
    - RAs are essential as they dictate how the software should be structured and designed to meet specific operational and strategic needs.

## Examples of Architectural Requirements
- **Performance:**
    - Specifications like response times or transaction throughput that the software must meet.
- **Data Storage:**
    - Decisions on where and how data is stored, often influenced by contractual obligations with service providers like AWS or compliance with regulations like GDPR in Europe.
- **Scalability:**
    - How the software should scale in response to demand, including considerations for load balancing and system configuration.

## Security and Compliance
- **Security Requirements:**
    - Ensuring that the software adheres to necessary security standards, such as PCI compliance for e-commerce applications.
- **Legal Requirements:**
    - Adhering to local and international laws, such as data retention policies and audit trails, which can affect how data is handled and stored.

## Architectural Governance
- **Standardization and Documentation:**
    - Establishing clear rules and documentation to guide development, including coding standards, version control practices, and review processes.

## Challenges in Implementation
- **Practical Application:**
    - While traditionally managed through extensive documentation like spreadsheets, modern development environments often handle RAs in a more organic, flexible manner.
- **Integration with Agile Environments:**
    - Aligning RAs with agile methodologies can be challenging, as agile favors adaptability and incremental changes over rigid, upfront specifications.

## Conclusion
- **Role of RAs in Development:**
    - Understanding and implementing RAs is fundamental to creating software that is robust, compliant, and capable of meeting business objectives efficiently.
- **Approach to RAs:**
    - Effective handling of RAs involves thorough discussion and collaboration with domain experts to ensure all aspects of the software's operation are considered and planned for.
