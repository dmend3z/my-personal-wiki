# Software Sustainability

## Introduction
- **Topic Importance:**
    - Discussing sustainability not in the environmental sense, but as it pertains to software development and maintenance.

## Cost of Software Development
- **High Expense:**
    - Developing software is inherently costly, impacting company budgets significantly, especially for technology-centric businesses like Uber, Lyft, or iFood.

## Software's Role in Business
- **Problem Solving:**
    - Software typically addresses specific business pain points, such as improving efficiency or scaling operations.
- **Example:**
    - Comparing the scalability of software solutions to traditional methods like phone calls for ordering food.

## Economic Impact of Software
- **Return on Investment:**
    - Over time, software should generate more value than the cost of its development and maintenance.
- **Challenges:**
    - Software that fails to evolve with the business can become a financial burden rather than an asset.

## Sustainability in Software Development
- **Need for Evolution:**
    - Software must be designed to evolve alongside the business, accommodating growth and changes without requiring frequent, costly overhauls.
- **Potential Downfalls:**
    - Poorly architected software may need to be completely rebuilt before it even breaks even, leading to a cycle of continuous investment without reaching profitability.

## Architectural Considerations
- **Importance of Good Architecture:**
    - Well-architected software is crucial to ensure it can support the business effectively over time without necessitating significant reworks.
- **Long-Term Value:**
    - The longer software operates effectively, the more value it returns relative to its initial development cost.

## Conclusion
- **Strategic Importance of Software Sustainability:**
    - Every software solution must be thoughtfully architected from the outset to ensure it can sustain long-term business goals and growth without becoming a liability.
