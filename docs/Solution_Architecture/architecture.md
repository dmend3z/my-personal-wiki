# Software Architecture 

## What is Software Architecture?
- **Definition:**
    - Software architecture is a discipline within software engineering.
    - It involves planning the software development lifecycle and is linked directly to the development processes.

## Role of a Software Architect
- **Daily Responsibilities:**
    - Contrary to common confusion with solution architecture, software architecture is considered more "low-level".
    - Software architects are heavily involved in the design process and often deal with the core structure of software systems.

## Impact on Organizational Structure
- **Influence on Team Division:**
    - The architecture of a system can dictate how teams are organized within a company.
    - Software components can influence the composition and focus of teams.

## Conway's Law
- **Explanation:**
    - Organizations tend to create systems that mimic their own communication structures.
    - Example: A company with separate backend and frontend developers will likely develop software with distinct backend and frontend components that interact with each other.

## Defining Software Architecture
- **Business Objectives and Constraints:**
    - Software architecture involves mapping out software components to align with business goals while considering constraints (e.g., budgetary, team, or technological limits).
- **ISO Definition:**
    - "Software architecture is the fundamental organization of a system, its components, their relationships, environments, and the principles guiding its design and evolution."

## Long-Term Perspective
- **Sustainability and Evolution:**
    - A key aspect of software architecture is planning for the long-term evolution of the software.
    - Architects need to design systems that can evolve and meet business needs over time.

## Conclusion
- **Summary:**
    - Software architecture is crucial in shaping how software is developed in relation to team dynamics and business strategies.
    - It helps in establishing a framework that not only meets current requirements but also accommodates future growth and changes.
