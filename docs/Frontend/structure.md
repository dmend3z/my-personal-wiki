# Project Directory Structure

```
/src
  /app            # Application pages and navigation-related components
  /core           # Core configurations and essential services
  /designSystem   # Style definitions and reusable UI components
  /layouts        # Common layout components like headers, footers, etc.
  /domain         # Business logic and data models
  /modules        # Domain-specific functionalities divided into modules
  /libraries      # Internal libraries and general helpers
```

## `/src` - Root Directory
Contains all the main code and resources for the frontend.

### `/app` - Application Pages
This directory contains all the pages and navigation-related components for the application. Each page should be a self-contained component that can be easily reused or moved around.

### `/core` - Core Configurations
Contains core configurations and essential services that are used throughout the application. This includes things like API clients, global state management, and other essential services.

### `/designSystem` - Style Definitions and Reusable UI Components
This directory contains all the style definitions and reusable UI components that are used throughout the application. This includes things like buttons, form elements, and other common UI components.

### `/layouts` - Common Layout Components
Contains common layout components like headers, footers, and other layout-related components that are used throughout the application.

### `/domain` - Business Logic and Data Models
Contains all the business logic and data models for the application. This includes things like services, repositories, and other domain-specific functionalities.

#### Structure example

```
/domain
  /user
  /product
    product.model.ts
    product.api.ts
```

### `/modules` - Domain-Specific Functionalities
Contains domain-specific functionalities divided into modules. Each module should be self-contained and encapsulate a specific set of functionalities.

### `/libraries` - Internal Libraries and General Helpers
Contains internal libraries and general helper functions that are used throughout the application. This includes things like utility functions, custom hooks, and other general-purpose functionalities.

## Conclusion
This project directory structure provides a clear separation of concerns and helps organize the codebase in a scalable and maintainable way.
